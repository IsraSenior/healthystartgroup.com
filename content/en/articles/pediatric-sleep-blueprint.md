# Pediatric Sleep Blueprint for Growing Minds

Sleep is the silent architect of childhood development. At Healthy Start Group we guide families through evidence-based routines that fit the realities of busy schedules.

## Foundations by age

| Age range | Recommended sleep | Key focus |
|-----------|-------------------|-----------|
| 0–12 months | 12–16 hours (including naps) | Consistent soothing cues |
| 1–5 years | 11–14 hours | Predictable pre-bed routine |
| 6–12 years | 9–12 hours | Technology boundaries |

## Designing an adaptive routine

1. **Anchor wake time** – choose a consistent morning schedule even on weekends.
2. **Create a wind-down ladder** – dim lights, quiet play, and read together.
3. **Pair healthy snacks** – offer protein and complex carbs 60 minutes before bed to stabilize blood sugar.

> A calm child follows a calm parent. Model the relaxation techniques you ask them to try.

## Troubleshooting common barriers

- **Nighttime worries** – use a “thought parking lot” notebook to capture fears before bed.
- **Late sports practices** – shift high-intensity activity earlier and focus on stretching at night.
- **Sibling room sharing** – provide individual reading lights and noise machines for personal space.

## Partnering with caregivers

Educate grandparents and childcare providers about the routine. Shared expectations reduce confusion and reinforce sleep cues wherever the child rests.

## When to seek extra support

Contact your pediatric clinician if your child snores loudly, gasps during sleep, or still feels exhausted after 10–12 hours of rest. Our team coordinates respiratory assessments and behavioral strategies tailored to each family.

Consistent rest fuels resilience, curiosity, and joy. Small habit changes today create confident sleepers tomorrow.
