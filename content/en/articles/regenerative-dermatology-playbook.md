# The Regenerative Dermatology Playbook

Regenerative dermatology merges medical-grade innovation with mindful routines at home. The result is resilient skin that looks radiant without overcorrection.

## Clinic to home continuum

We structure each treatment plan across three phases:

1. **Prime** – gentle exfoliation, LED sessions, and hydration masks prepare the skin.
2. **Correct** – microneedling with exosome serums or low-energy resurfacing.
3. **Protect** – barrier-restoring moisturizers and sun protection to lock in results.

## Vital daily rituals

- **Morning** – antioxidant serum, lightweight moisturizer, and mineral SPF 50.
- **Evening** – double cleanse, peptide repair serum, and occlusive night cream.
- **Weekly** – probiotic mask to balance the microbiome.

> Layer products from thinnest to thickest textures. This ensures active ingredients reach their target depth.

## Nutrition for glowing skin

- Prioritize omega-3 rich foods like salmon and flax.
- Sip two liters of water infused with citrus to support collagen synthesis.
- Limit high-glycemic snacks that accelerate glycation and dullness.

## Mind-body synergy

Stress raises cortisol, weakening the skin barrier. Integrate five-minute breathing sessions or gentle yoga to maintain calm, especially after procedures.

## When to contact your provider

Reach out if redness lasts more than 48 hours, itching intensifies, or you feel unsure about product layering. The Healthy Start dermatology studio answers messages daily so you never navigate recovery alone.

Healthy skin is a partnership. With consistent care and professional coaching, every patient can achieve a luminous, confident complexion.
